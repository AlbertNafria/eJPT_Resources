This repo contains notes and cli tool usages which I wrote down during the
preparation of this certification. Also want to write some thoughts on this
certification and my experience.

## Skillset

Even we are talking about a beginner entry-level certification in penetration
testing, the exploitation phases I went through were considerably easy. No need
to code exploits or even to modify existing ones. Everything can be done through
metasploit or using legitimate tools after getting some credentials.

I think one of the most important skills required is a good understanding on the
Linux Command Line. I consider that the fact I've been using Linux for few years
has helped me a lot in passing it, many points were thanks to it.

## Time

48 hours is a lot of time for exploiting every single machine, but is great
having that much and don't hurry up. I took me 19 hours counting the time I
spent having lunch, pauses and even a 3 hours nap.
