# eJTP Resources

[eJPT](./res/eJPT.pdf)

This repo contains the notes taken during the preparation of the eLearning
Junior Penetration Testing (eJPTv2). This notes are very concise, just cover the
essential information taken from the course for consultancy during the
certification. Are not for studying the materials but for having the main
commands on hand and the structure of a Penetration Test and the methodologies.

Apart from the course that [INE](https://ine.com) brings to prepare the certification, and even it
is enough to pass it, I found very useful to practice with some
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) rooms, although sometimes those are even
harder than the labs proposed by INE.
